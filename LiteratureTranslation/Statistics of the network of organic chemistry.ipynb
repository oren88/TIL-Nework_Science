    "유기 화학은 반응 네트워크로 표현되고 그래프 이론의 수학적 도구로 연구 될 수 있습니다. 이 논문에서는 유기 반응 네트워크의 구조가 여러 그래프 이론 측정법을 사용하여 연구되었다.네트워크는 Reaxys에서 다운로드 한 화학 공간 섹션을 기반으로했습니다. 연구 된 화학 영역은 테르펜의 화학적 성질에 해당하며 초기 3500만개의 반응을 걸러낸 후 12,238,931 종과 12,939,422 반응을 포함합니다.\n",
    "네트워크 통계분석을 통해 훨씬 작은 규모의 네트워크를 분석한 초기 문헌에서 보고된 것처럼 네트워크는 scale-free이었음이 확인되었습니다.\n",
    "다른 기술 또는 비 기술 영역의 많은 네트워크는 노드가 연결 상태가 좋거나 연결 상태가 좋지 않은 노드에 연결되어 있는지 여부를 노드가 선호한다는 것을 보여 주지만 화학적으로 이러한 경향은 관찰되지 않았습니다.\n",
    "반응 네트워크가 \"작은 세계\"의 행동을 보이고 사회적 네트워크에서 마주 치는 '분리의 6 단계'에 대한 직유에서 평균적으로 모든 분자는 여섯 가지 합성 단계에서 다른 분자로 만들어 질 수 있음이 밝혀졌습니다. 스케일없는 네트워크에는 배선 패턴에 허브가 있습니다. 이러한 허브가 잘 연구되고 있는것 뿐만아닌 자주 사용되는 것은 아닌지 조사함으로써, 네트워크의 부하가 많은 부분에 집중되어 네트워크의 구조가 화학의 사용에 영향을 주거나  또는 그 반대의 경우에도 분자 계층을 암시하는 것을 알아냈습니다"

    "More specifically, this paper will aim to answer the question what statistical properties can be observed for the section of the network studied here. It will seek to reassess if the network is indeed scale-free, whether it exhibits ‘small-world’ behaviour, and if it displays evidence of a hierarchy of nodes. This will be accomplished by investigating the degree distribution of the network, its assortativity, the existence of degree correlations and the shortest path lengths observed. Furthermore, the clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality will be investigated. Taking the results from these analyses, it will be possible to form a more complete picture of the network. Ultimately, this can be used to gain a better understanding of the chemical knowledge contained within the network. We deliberately do not focus on the historical development of the network, for example, the development of network ‘hubs’, as we are aware of a separate focused study on this sole topic to be completed shortly."

    "Given that graph theoretical tools do not form part of the standard chemistry or chemical engineering toolset, each of the investigated metrics is introduced in detail and its theoretical background is given in the following section. The methods used to quantify the statistics are described in the Methodology section and an interpretation of their relevance to our understanding of chemistry is given in detail in the Results and discussion section. However, a brief outline of their significance is as follows: scale-free networks follow precisely defined evolution patterns allowing conclusions about further development of the chemical landscape to be made, while also implying the existence of ‘hubs’, meaning that the average distance between two molecules is greatly reduced. The assortativity and the degree correlation, collectively, measure the mixing patterns of the network. This means that it reveals information whether a given molecule, on average, is more likely to connect to a hub or a molecule in the periphery; in other words, it might reveal whether a platform molecule is likely to react into a specialised molecule or another platform molecule. Studying the small-world behaviour of the network is very important in understanding how long the paths between two molecules are on average, i.e. how many reactions it takes to synthesise one out of the other, thus giving insights into how the network can be navigated more optimally. Analysing the betweenness centrality finally allows an assessment of the importance of molecules to synthesis routes in general by quantifying what share of paths runs via them."

A graph is primarily an abstract mathematical object that does not necessarily consider its realisation in nature. A network, on the other hand, is a “real-life” object as opposed to a purely mathematical one.21"

An important caveat is that though the overall network may have no scale in its degree distribution, both the other properties of the network and the degree distribution of sub-networks may have scales present."

For example, this means that the average distance between nodes, i.e. the number of edges that need to be traversed en route between the two, is lower than that in a random network,30 or that the network exhibits a much greater degree of clustering than might be expected of a comparable random network."

    "A number of recent studies have shown the existence of a hierarchical structure in many real-life networks,32–34 in which groups of vertices can be subdivided into smaller clusters of vertices, which each divide into yet smaller groups over several iterations.23,35,36 This phenomenon was first observed when examining metabolic networks.37 These networks on the one hand exhibited very high degrees of clustering, indicative of a modular architecture, while on the other hand having a power-law degree distribution. This was surprising as a highly modular architecture greatly restricts the degree distribution, while a scale-free architecture runs counter to a modular organisation. This apparent contradiction was overcome by using a heuristic model that combined nodes into densely connected local clusters, which in turn combined into less dense, larger groups, which again combined into even less cohesive larger groups, thus allowing communication between the densely clustered modules via a small number of hubs.23,32 As a consequence, a hierarchical network is able to explain local clustering and modularity, short path lengths, and scale-free degree distributions."

    "Clustering can be quantified with the clustering coefficient, which measures the amount of interlinking between neighbours of a given node. It has been argued that a key signature of a hierarchical network is the existence of an inverse scaling between the clustering coefficient and the degree. This is caused by the fact that increasing the cluster size, which means an increase in the degree, leads to a decreasing degree of interlinking, meaning a decreasing clustering coefficient. This gives rise to a power-law behaviour. Evidence of this was reported in a number of sources,23,32,37,39–42 though Soffer and Vázquez contest this claim, arguing that the trend observed is merely a consequence of correlations between the degrees of neighbouring nodes."

    "In practice, real-life networks do not necessarily exactly fit into one of the presented categories and are thus classified as “complex networks”.43 Despite spanning a vast field of disparate topics, it has been found that many of these networks are characterised by the same topological properties.30 One such property, for example, is the “small world effect”, first popularised in sociology. It describes the fact that most nodes can be connected via only a few edges,44 far fewer than expected by chance. This was found to be the case in virtually all computational or biological networks.15,23 Similarly, a very common phenomenon in complex networks is a degree correlation, where it is possible to establish a correlation between a vertex's degree and the degree of the vertices it connects to, i.e. a correlation between the number of connections of a node and the number of connections of its neighbours."

This means that it is not merely sufficient to count the number of edges connected to a node, but that the measure needs to be further refined into an “out-degree”, kout, giving the number of edges emanating from the node, and an “in-degree”, kin, giving the number of edges which have the node as the target."

For this reason, inclusion of the multistep reactions skews the network's statistics and, thus, they were excluded from the analysis set. This brought the number of reactions down to 13,770,205. Deletion of incomplete reactions, namely those that had either no products or no reactants declared in Reaxys, left the total number of reactions analysed at 12,939,422."

    "The condensed and sanitised data set was converted into a network using Python scripts and an implementation of graph-tool in Python2.7. This was carried out by assigning each chemical species contained in the data set as a vertex in the network and then for each reaction connecting all reactants to all products via a directed edge going from the reactant to the product. Each node and edge was then annotated with various properties, such as Reaxys IDs, to allow their matching to a database entry. Multiple different wiring schemes are of course possible, ranging from the “all to all” scheme employed here on the one end of the spectrum to a “one to one” scheme, where only the heaviest reactant and product of each reaction are added to and linked in the network resulting in only one edge per reaction. Fialkowski et al. have carried out an investigation of the effects of the choice of the wiring scheme on the properties of the network and found them to be negligible."

    "In order to analyse the degree distribution, the in-degree of every node in the network was then written to one file and the out-degree to another file. Firstly, given the fact that a power law is undefined for a value of k = 0, all nodes that had a degree of 0 were deleted from the respective file. Subsequently, the data were analysed using the Python package “powerlaw” in Python2.7."

    "Seeing as the degree distribution is necessarily discrete, discrete=True was set in the code and estimate_discrete=False. Furthermore, it was specified that kmin = 1.0 as this represents the lowest possible degree a node can have under the power-law model. The “powerlaw” package was then used to fit the data to a power-law model. An important fact to bear in mind is that the probability density functions (pdf) of heavy-tailed distributions are notoriously noisy in their tail as the number of observations of a given value, in this case the degree, is very low in the tail. This makes it more convenient to use cumulative distribution functions (cdfs), expressing the likelihood of observing a value less than or equal to the given value.Using the cdf, it is possible to determine the slope, 1 − γ, and thus the degree exponent with far greater accuracy compared to using the degree distribution, while also showing possible truncation of the tail more clearly. The other approach towards smoothing out the fluctuation in the tail of the pdf is to use binning if employing bins of exponential length.69 Both techniques were employed here."

    "Perhaps more relevant is the question whether the data is best described using a power law. The log-likelihood ratio between two candidate models, R, was computed along with its significance value (p-value) using the “powerlaw” package.67 A positive value of the logarithm of the ratio of the likelihood of the first distribution and the likelihood of the second distribution indicates that the data is more likely to be described by the first distribution, in this case a power law, and a negative value indicates that the other candidate model provides a better explanation.67,68 Though R gives us an estimate of which distribution is more likely, it, like any other quantity, is subject to statistical fluctuations. Thus, if the true value of R is close to zero, a fluctuation can lead to a sign change, meaning that we cannot trust the value of R.68 For this reason, we also require the p-value as a measure of whether the observed sign of R is statistically significant. This means that if we observe a small value of p (ref. 68 suggests a cut-off of 0.1, in ref. 67 a cut-off of 0.05 was suggested), it is unlikely that the sign of R is the result of a chance fluctuation and, hence, is able to tell which model is favoured. If the p-value is large, the sign is most likely the result of a statistical fluctuation, and the test does not favour either model as a description of the observed data."

    "The defining feature of a power law is the fact that it displays a heavy-tailed distribution. For this reason, the goodness of fit using a power law is compared to that of a lognormal distribution and a stretched exponential distribution, which both exhibit heavy tails without following a power law.67 By definition, a heavy tail is not exponentially bounded. Thus, if the data is described more accurately by an exponential distribution, there is little argument for observing a heavy-tailed distribution, meaning that the data does not follow a power law.67 Finally, a truncated power law is tested for, representing a mixture of the exponential distribution and the power law."

    "The assortativity was calculated for both the in- and the out-degree as well as the combined degree using a function implemented in graph-tool. This was done both when allowing parallel edges and when allowing only one edge so as to allow conclusions about the wiring scheme's impact on the value of the assortativity."

    "## 3.3. Degree correlation\n",
    "In practice, eqn (5) can be evaluated more easily by averaging the degree of all nearest neighbours of all nodes of degree k for all values of k, which can then be plotted against each other. If no correlation exists between the two degrees, [k with combining macron]nn (k) will be independent of k (i.e. r = 0), while an increasing function in k corresponds to assortative mixing and a decreasing function to disassortative mixing. For a perfectly assortative network, one would expect the points to fall onto the x–y diagonal. Naturally, this function can be calculated for the in-, out- and total-degree. The results of doing so will be shown subsequently."
